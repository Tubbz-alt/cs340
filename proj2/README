Apology:
This program is written largely in python, however I found the execution
of some of the trees to be too slow in python, so I created a c lib that
handles the trees.

Compiling:
Simply run 'make' to create the sorts library.

Running:
Be sure to compile the sorts library, then run 'python main.py'.

Also, be sure to leave the input files in directories named 'perm' and
'sorted' respectively.
